# typing-rust (in-progress)

Try it with `cargo install typing_test` and run `typing_test`

Fast and minimal typing test binary crate written in rust
- graphics library for rendering words and quotes
- display typing speed
- can be timer, by number of words, or quote (akin to monkeytype)
- offline default words and quotes (done)
- online web scraping for more quotes and words
- has themes, default is gruvbox

Tech Stack:
- macroquad for graphics library and keyboard input

Special thanks to Monkeytype for inspiring me to build this and providing the default words.
