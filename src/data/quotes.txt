The Law of Irrationality - The Laws of Human Nature
You like to imagine yourself in control of your fate, consciously planning the course of your life as best you can. But you are largely unaware of how deeply your emotions dominate you. They make you veer toward ideas that soothe your ego. They make you look for evidence that confirms what you already want to believe. They make you see what you want to see, depending on your mood, and this disconnect from reality is the source of the bad decisions and negative patterns that haunt your life. Rationality is the ability to counteract these emotional effects, to think instead of react, to open your mind to what is really happening, as opposed to what you are feeling. It does not come naturally; it is a power we must cultivate, but in going so we realize our greatest potential.
We imagine we are looking for the truth, or being realistic, when in fact we are holding on to ideas that bring a release from tension and soothe our egos, make us feel superior. This pleasure principle in thinking is the source of all of our mental biases.
But because of the pleasure principle and its unconscious influence, we manage to find the evidence that confirms what we want to believe. This is known as confirmation bias.
Your first impulse should always be to find the evidence that dis-confirms your most cherished beliefs and those of others. That is true science.
The way to recognize this in yourself and in others is by noticing behavior that is suddenly childish in its intensity and seemingly out of character.
Be extra wary of sudden success and attention - they are not built on anything that lasts and they have an addictive pull. And the fall is always painful.
In fact, stress or tension can reveal flaws in people that they have carefully concealed from view. It is often wise to observe people in such moments, precisely as a way to judge their true character.
The Emotional Self thrives on ignorance. The moment you are aware of how it operates and dominates you is the moment it loses its hold on you and can be tamed. Therefore, your first step toward the rational is always inward.
See other people as phenomena, as natural as comets or plants. They simply exist. They come in all varieties, making life rich and interesting. Work with what they give you, instead of resisting and trying to change them. Make understanding people a fun game, the solving of puzzles.

The Law of Narcissism - The Laws of Human Nature
We all naturally possess the most remarkable tool for connecting to people and attaining social power - empathy. When cultivated and properly used, it can allow us to see into the moods and minds of others, giving us the power to anticipate people's actions and gently lower their resistance. This instrument, however, is blunted by our habitual self-absorption. We are all narcissists, some deeper on the spectrum than others. Our mission in life is to come to terms with this self-love and learn how to turn our sensitivity outward, toward others, instead of inward. We must recognize at the same time the toxic narcissists among us before getting enmeshed in their dramas and poisoned by their envy.

The Law of Role-playing - The Laws of Human Nature
People tend to wear the mask that shows them off in the best possible light-humble, confident, diligent. They say the right things, smile, and seem interested in our ideas. They learn to conceal their insecurities and envy. If we take this appearance for reality, we never really know their true feelings, and on occasion we are blinded by their sudden resistance, hostility, and manipulative actions. Fortunately, the mask has cracks in it. People continually leak out their true feelings and unconscious desires in the nonverbal cues they cannot completely control - facial expressions, vocal inflections, tension in the body, and nervous gestures. You must master this language by transforming yourself into a superior reader of men and women. Armed with this knowledge, you can take the proper defensive measures. On the other hand, since appearance are what people judge you by, you must learn how to present the best front and play your role to maximum effect.

The Law of Compulsive Behavior - The Laws of Human Nature
When choosing people to work and associate with, do not be mesmerized by their reputation or taken in by the surface image they try to project. Instead, train yourself to look deep within them and see their character. People's character is formed in their earliest years and by their daily habits. It is what compels them to repeat certain actions in their lives and fall into negative patterns. Look closely at such patterns and remember that people never do something just once. They will inevitably repeat their behavior. Gauge the relative strength of their character by how well they handle adversity, their ability to adapt and work with other people, their patience and ability to learn. Always gravitate toward those who display signs of strength, and avoid the many toxic types out there. Know thoroughly your own character so you can break your compulsive patterns and take control of your destiny.

The Law of Covetousness - The Laws of Human Nature
Absence and presence have very primal effects upon us. Too much presence suffocates; a degree of absence spurs our interest. We are marked by the continual desire to possess what we do not have - the object projected by our fantasies. Learn to create some mystery around you, to use strategic absence to make people desire your return, to want to possess you. Dangle in front of others what they are missing most in life, what they are forbidden to have, and they will go crazy with desire. The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. Overcome this weakness in yourself by embracing your circumstances, your fate.

The Law of Shortsightedness - The Laws of Human Nature
It is in the animal part of your nature to be most impressed by what you can see and hear in the present - the latest news reports and trends, the opinions and actions of the people around you, whatever seems the most dramatic. This is what makes you fall for alluring schemes that promise quick results and easy money. This is also what makes you overreact to present circumstances - becoming overly exhilarated or panicky as events turn one direction or the other. Learn to measure people by the narrowness or breadth of their vision; avoid entangling yourself with those who cannot see the consequences of their actions, who are in a continual reactive mode. They will infect you with this energy. Your eyes must be on the larger trends that govern events, on that which is not immediately visible. Never lose sight of your long-term goals. With an elevated perspective, you will have the patience and clarity to reach almost any objective.

The Law of Defensiveness - The Laws of Human Nature
Life is harsh and people competitive. We naturally must look after our own interests. We also want to feel that we are independent, doing our own bidding. That is why when others try to persuade or change us, we become defensive and resistant. To give in challenges our need to feel autonomous. That is why to get people to move from their defensive positions you must always make it seem like what they are doing is of their own free will. Creating a feeling of mutual warmth helps soften people's resistance and makes them want to help. Never attack people for their beliefs or make them feel insecure about their intelligence or goodness - that will only strengthen their defensiveness and make your task impossible. Make them feel that by doing what you want they are being noble and altruistic - the ultimate lure. Learn to tame your own stubborn nature and free your mind from its defensive and closed positions, unleashing your creative powers.

The Law of Self-Sabotage - The Laws of Human Nature
Each of us has a particular way of looking at the world, of interpreting events and the actions of people around us. This is our attitude, and it determines such of what happens to us in life. If our attitude is essentially fearful, we see the negative in every circumstance. We stop ourselves from taking chances. We blame others for mistakes and fail to learn from them. If we feel hostile or suspicious, we make others feel such emotions in our presence. We sabotage our career and relationships by unconsciously creating the circumstance we fear the most. The human attitude, however, is malleable. By making our attitude more positive, open, and tolerant of other people, we can spark a different dynamic - we can learn from adversity, create opportunities out of nothing, and draw people to us. We must explore the limits of our willpower and how far it can take us.
Never try to lift up depressive people by preaching to them about the wonderfulness of life. Instead, it is best to go along with their gloomy opinion of the world while subtly drawing them into positive experiences that can elevate their moods and energy without any direct appeal.

The Law of Repression - The Laws of Human Nature
People are rarely who they seem to be. Lurking beneath their polite, affable exterior is inevitably a dark, shadow side consisting of the insecurities and the aggressive, selfish impulses they repress and carefully conceal from public view. This dark side leaks out in behavior that will baffle and harm you. Learn to recognize the signs of the Shadow before they become toxic. See people's overt traits - toughness, saintliness, et cetera - as covering up the opposite quality. You must become aware of your own dark side. In being conscious of it you can control and channel the creative energies that lurk in your unconscious. By integrating the dark side into your personality, you will be a more complete human and will radiate an authenticity that will draw people to you.
Your task as a student of human nature is to recognize and examine the dark side of your character. Once subjected to conscious scrutiny, it loses its destructive power.
A person suddenly loses his or her habitual self-control and sharply expresses deep resentment or says something biting and hurtful. In the aftermath of such a release, they may blame it on stress; they may say they did not mean any of it, when in fact the opposite is the case - the Shadow has spoken. Take what they said at face value.
It is very easy to get caught up in the appearance and first impression. Watch for the signs and emergence of the opposite over time. It is much easier to deal with such types once you understand them.
Be extra wary of those who out of their way to make a show of their difference.
We are particularly sensitive to traits and weaknesses in others that we are repressing in ourselves.

The Law of Envy - The Laws of Human Nature
We humans are naturally compelled to compare ourselves with one another. We are continually measuring people's status, the levels of respect and attention they receive, and noticing any differences between what we have and what they have. For some of us, this need to compare serves as a spur to excel through our work. For others, it can turn into deep envy - feelings of inferiority and frustration that lead to covert attacks and sabotage. Nobody admits to acting out of envy. You must recognize the early warning signs - praise and bids for friendship that seem effusive and out of proportion; subtle digs at you under the guise of good-natured humor; apparent uneasiness with your success. It is most likely to crop up among friends or your peers in the same profession. Learn to deflect envy by drawing attention away from yourself. Develop your sense of self-worth from internal standards and not incessant comparisons.
But in order for enviers to feel entitled to take harmful actions, they must create a narrative: everything the other person does reveals some negative trait; they do not deserve their superior position.
Envy entails the admission to ourselves that we are inferior to another person in something we value. Not only is it painful to admit this inferiority, but it is even worse for others to see that we are feeling this.
Tell suspected enviers some good news about yourself - a promotion, a new and exciting love interest, a book contract. You will notice a quick expression of disappointment. Their tone of voice as they congratulate you will betray some tension and strain. Equally, tell them some misfortune of yours and notice the uncontrollable micro-expression of joy in your pain, what is commonly known as schadenfreude. Their eyes light up for a fleeting second. People who are envious cannot help feeling some glee when they hear of the bad luck of those they envy.
Criticism of you that seems sincere but not directly related to anything you have actually done is usually a strong sign of envy.
Always play it safe by deferring to bosses, making them look better, and earning their trust. Couch your brilliant ideas as their ideas. Let them get all the credit for your hard work. Your time to shine will come, but not if you inadvertently stimulate their insecurities.
Nothing is ever so perfect as it seems, and often we would see that we are mistaken if we only looked closely enough.

The Law of Grandiosity - The Laws of Human Nature
We humans have a deep need to think highly of ourselves. If that opinion of our goodness, greatness, and brilliance diverges enough from reality, we become grandiose. We imagine our superiority. Often a small measure of success will elevate our natural grandiosity to even more dangerous levels. Our high self-opinion has now been confirmed by events. We forget the role that luck may have played in the success, or the contributions of others. We imagine we have the golden touch. Losing contact with reality, we make irrational decisions. That is why our success often does not last. Look for the signs of elevated grandiosity in yourself and in others - overbearing certainty in the positive outcome of your plans; excessive touchiness if criticized; a disdain for any form of authority. Counteract the pull of grandiosity by maintaining a realistic assessment of yourself and your limits. Tie any feelings of greatness.
Any success that we have in life inevitably depends on some good luck, timing, the contributions of others, the teachers who helped us along the way, the whims of the public in need of something new.
The gods are merciless with those who fly too high on the wings of grandiosity, and they will make you pay the price.
Finally, you will need to manage your own grandiose tendencies. Grandiosity has some positive and productive uses. The exuberance and high self-belief that come from it can be channeled into your work and help inspire you.
The greatest protection you can have against grandiosity is to maintain a realistic attitude. You know what subjects and activities you are naturally attracted to. You cannot be skilled at everything. You need to play to your strengths and not imagine you can be great at whatever you put your mind to.
We feel our presence enlarged through our work, through what we contribute to society.
If you stay too long in the imagination phase, what you create will tend to be grandiose and detached from reality. If you only listen to feedback and try to make the work a complete reflection of what others tell you or want, the work will be conventional and flat. By maintaining a continual dialogue between reality (feedback) and your imagination, you will create something practical and powerful.
Your being alive is an equally unlikely and uncanny event. It required a very particular chain of events leading to the meeting of your parents and your birth, all of which could have gone very differently. At this moment, as you read this, you are conscious of life along with billions of others, and only for a brief time, until you die. Fully taking this reality is what we shall call the Sublime. It cannot be put into words. It is too awesome. Feeling a part of that tenuous experiment of life is a kind of reverse grandiosity - you are not disturbed by your relative smallness but rather ecstatic at the sense of being a drop in the ocean.

The Law of Gender Rigidity - The Laws of Human Nature
All of us have masculine and feminine qualities - some of this is genetic, and some of it comes from the profound influence of the parent of the opposite sex. But in the need to present a consistent identity in society, we tend to repress these qualities, over identifying with the masculine or feminine role expected of us. And we pay a price for this. We lose valuable dimensions to our character. Our thinking and ways of acting become rigid. Our relationships with members of the opposite sex suffer as we project onto them our own fantasies and hostilities. You must become aware of these lost masculine or feminine traits and slowly reconnect to them, unleashing creative powers in the process. You will become more fluid in your thinking. In bringing out the masculine or feminine undertone to your character, you will fascinate people by being authentically yourself. Do not play the expected gender role, but rather create the one that suits you.
In the theater of life, expand the roles that you play. Don't worry about people's reactions to any change in you they sense. You are not so easy to categorize, which will fascinate them and give you the power to play with their perceptions of you, altering them at will.
Remember that this primal relationship is charged energy, excitement, and obsessions that we repressed but yearning to come out. A person who triggers these associations in us will be a magnet for our attention, even though we are not aware of the source of our attraction.
Keep in mind that when you are the target of other people's projections, the temptation is to want to live up to their idealization of you, to be their fantasy. You get caught up in their excitement and you want to believe you are as great, strong, or empathetic as they imagine. Without realizing it, you begin to play the role they want you to play.

The Law of Aimlessness - The Laws of Human Nature
Unlike animals, with their instincts to guide them past dangers, we humans have to rely upon our conscious decisions. We do the best we can when it comes to our career path and handling the inevitable setbacks in life. But in the back of our minds we can sense an overall lack of direction, as we are pulled this way and that way by our moods and by the opinions of others. How did we end up in this job, in this place? Such drifting can lead to dead ends. The way to avoid such a fate is to develop a sense of purpose, discovering our calling in life and using such knowledge to guide us in our decisions. We come to know ourselves more deeply - our tastes and inclinations. We trust ourselves, knowing which battles and detours to avoid. Even our moments of doubt, even our failures have a purpose - to toughen us up. With such energy and direction, our actions have unstoppable force.
Do not try to bypass the work of discovering your calling or imagine that it will simply come to you naturally. Although it may come to a few people early in life or in a lightning-bolt moment, for most of us it requires continual introspection and effort. Experimenting with the skills and options related to your personality and inclinations is not only the single most essential step in developing a high sense of purpose, it is perhaps the most important step in life in general. Knowing in a deep way who you are, your uniqueness, will make it that much easier to avoid all of the other pitfalls of human nature.
Reading a variety of books for entertainment, in rapid succession, leads to a diminishing sense of satisfaction with each book; our minds are overwhelmed and overstimulated; and we must reach for a new one right away. Reading one excellent book and absorbing ourselves in it has a relaxing and uplifting effect as we discover hidden riches within it. In the moments when we are not reading, we think of the book again and again.
[Cynicism] presents itself as cool and hip. Its adherents display a somewhat apathetic and sardonic air that gives them the appearance that they see through it all. But the attitude is not what it seems. Behind it is the adolescent pose of appearing to not care, which disguises a great fear of trying and failing, of standing out and being ridiculed. It stems from sheer laziness and offers its believers consolation for their lack of accomplishments.
As hunters for purpose and meaning, we want to move in the opposite direction. Reality is not brutal and ugly - it contains much that is sublime, beautiful, and worthy of wonder. We see this in the great words of other achievers. We want to have more encounters with the Sublime. Nothing is more awe-inspiring than the human brain itself - its complexity, its untapped potential. We want to realize some of that potential in our lives, not wallow in the cynical slacker attitude. We see a purpose behind everything that we experience and see. In the end, what we want is to fuse the curiosity and excitement we had toward the world as children, when almost everything seemed enchanting, with our adult intelligence.

The Law of Conformity - The Laws of Human Nature
We have a side to our character that we are generally unaware of - our social personality, the different person we become when we operate in groups of people. In the group setting, we unconsciously imitate what others are saying and doing. We think differently, more concerned with fitting in and believing what others believe. We feel different emotions, infected by the group mood. We are more prone to taking risks, to acting irrationally, because everyone else is. This social personality can come to dominate who we are. Listening so much to others and conforming our behavior to them, we slowly lose a sense of our uniqueness and the ability to think for ourselves. The only solution is to develop self-awareness and a superior understanding of the changes that occur in us in groups. With such intelligence, we can become superior social actors, able to outwardly fit in and cooperate with others on a high level, while retaining our independence and rationality.
The results of hundreds of thousands of years of evolution and development cannot be radically re-engineered by some scheme, particularly when it involves the behavior of humans in groups, which inevitably conforms to certain ancient patterns.
The first and primary effect on you in any group is the desire to fit in and cement your sense of belonging.
Whenever you feel unusually certain and excited about a plan or idea, you must step back and gauge whether is it a viral group effect operating on you. If you can detach yourself for a moment from your excitement, you might notice how your thinking is used to rationalize your emotions, to confirm the certainty you want to feel. Never relinquish your ability to doubt, reflect, and consider other options - your rationality as an individual is your only protection against the madness that can overcome a group. 
One thing to keep in mind: no matter the type of culture, or how disruptive it might have been in its origins, the longer a group exists and the larger it grows, the more conservative it will become. This is an inevitable result of the desire to hold on to what people have made or built, and to rely on tried-and-true ways to maintain the status quo. This creeping conservatism will often be the death of the group, because it slowly loses the ability to adapt.
What creates a functional, healthy dynamic is the ability of the group to maintain a tight relationship to reality. The reality for a group is as follows: It exists in order to get things done, to make things, to solve problems. It has certain resources it can draw upon - the labor and strengths of its members, its finances. It operates in a particular environment that is almost always highly competitive and constantly changing. The healthy group puts primary emphasis on the work itself, on getting the most out of its resources and adapting to all of the inevitable changes. Not wasting time on endless political games, such a group can accomplish ten times more than the dysfunctional variety. It brings out the best in human nature - people's empathy, their ability to work with others on a high level. It remains the ideal for all of us. We shall call this ideal the reality group.
In the end, you want a group that has been through a few wars, dealt with them reasonably well, and now is battle-tested. They do not wilt at the sign of new obstacles and in fact welcome them. With such a group, you can slowly expand the limits of what you can ask of them, and the members feel a powerful upward pull to meet challenges and prove themselves. Such a group can move mountains.

The Law of Fickleness
Although styles of leadership change with the times, one constant remains: people are always ambivalent about those in power. They want to be led but also to feel free; they want to be protected and enjoy prosperity without making sacrifices; they both worship the king and want to kill him. When you are the leader of a group, people are continually prepared to turn on you the moment you seem weak or experience a setback. Do not succumb to the prejudices of the times, imagining that what you need to do to gain their loyalty is to seem to be their equal or their friend; people will doubt your strength, become suspicious of your motives, and respond with hidden contempt. Authority is the delicate art of creating the appearance of power, legitimacy, and fairness while getting people to identify with you as a leader who is in their service. If you want to lead, you must master this art from early on in your life. Once you have gained people's trust, they will stand by you as their leader, no matter the bad circumstances.
It is a fundamental fact of human nature that our emotions are almost always ambivalent, rarely pure and simple.
When leaders fail to establish these twin pillars of authority - vision and empathy - what often happens is the following: Those in the group feel the disconnect and distance between them and leadership. They know that deep down they are viewed as replaceable pawns. They sense the overall lack of direction and the constant tactical reactions to events. And so, in subtle ways, they begin to feel resentful and to lose respect. They listen less attentively to what such leaders say. They spend more hours in the day thinking of their own interests and future. They join or form factions. They work at half or three-quarter speed.
Without authority in the arts, there is nothing to rebel against, no prior movement to overturn, no deep thinking to assimilate and later even reject. There is only an amorphous world of trends that flicker away with increasing speed. Without parents as authority figures, we cannot go through the critical stage of rebellion in adolescence, in which we reject their ideas and discover our own identity. We grow up lost, constantly searching outside ourselves for that identity. Without teachers and masters whom we acknowledge as superior and worthy of respect, we cannot learn from their experience and wisdom, perhaps even seeking later on to surpass them with new and better ideas.

Arthur Schopenhauer
On hearing of the interesting events which have happened in the course of a man's experience, many people will wish that similar things had happened in their lives too, completely forgetting that they should be envious rather of the mental aptitude which lent those events the significance they possess when he describes them.

Henrik Ibsen
This longing to commit a madness stays with us throughout our lives. Who has not, when standing with someone by an abyss or high up on a tower, had a sudden impulse to push the other over? And how is it that we hurt those we love although we know that remorse will follow? Our whole being is nothing but a fight against the dark forces within ourselves. To live is to war with trolls in heart and soul. To write is to sit in judgment on oneself.

Carl Jung
Unfortunately there is no doubt about the fact that man is, as a whole, less good than he images himself or wants to be. Everyone carries a shadow, and the less it is embodied in the individual's conscious life, the blacker and dense it is.

Crime and Punishment
Existence along had never been enough for him; he had always wanted more. Perhaps it was only from the force of his desires that he had regarded himself as a man to whom more was permitted than to others.

Marcel Proust
It is the terrible deception of love that it begins by engaging us in play not with a woman of the external world but with a doll fashioned in our brain - the only woman moreover that we have always at our disposal, the only one we shall ever possess.

Friedrich Nietzsche
He who has a why to live can bear with almost any how.
Madness is something rare in individuals - but in groups, parties, people, and ages it is the rule.

The Art of War
Plan for what is difficult while it is easy, do what is great while it is small. The most difficult things in the world must be done while they are still easy, the greatest things in the world must be done while they are still small. For this reason sages never do what is great, and this is why they can achieve that greatness.
Indeed, to be able to do something before it exists, sense something before it becomes active, see something before it sprouts, are three abilities that develop interdependently. Then nothing is sensed but is comprehended, nothing is undertaken without response, nowhere does one go without benefit.
When there is no choice but to use them, it is best to be calm and free from greed, and not celebrate victory.
According to Sun Tzu, it is the unemotional, reserved, calm, detached warrior who wins, not the hothead seeking vengeance and not the ambitious seeker of fortune.
Be extremely subtle, even to the point of formlessness. Be extremely mysterious, even to the point of soundlessness. Thereby you can be the director of the opponent's fate.
The skilled can fill their people with energy to confront the emptiness of others, while the incompetent drains their people of energy in face of the fullness of others.
Those who are skilled in combat do not become angered, those who are skilled at winning do not become afraid. Thus the wise win before they fight, while the ignorant fight to win.
The five things are the way, the weather, the terrain, the leadership, and discipline.
The Way means inducing the people to have the same aim as the leadership, so that they will share death and share life, without fear of danger.
Even though you are competent, appear to be incompetent. Though effective, appear to be ineffective.
The one with many strategic factors in his favor wins, the one with few strategic factors in his favor loses - how much the more so for one with no strategic factors in his favor.
Much strategy prevails over little strategy, so those with no strategy cannot but be defeated.
Advantages and disadvantages are interdependent - first know the disadvantages, then you know the advantages.
To be able also means to be able to endure anger and humiliation, not going out to meet the opponent's challenges.
If you cannot be strong, and yet cannot be weak, this will result in your defeat.
Attack is the time for defense, defense is a strategy of attack. If you know this, you will not be in danger even if you fight a hundred battles.
Disorder arises from order, cowardice arises from courage, weakness arises from strength.
If you make opponents come to fight, then their force will always be empty. If you do not go to fight, then your force will always be full. This is the art of emptying others and filling yourself.
So in the case of those who are skilled in their attack, their opponents do not know where to defend. In the case of those skilled in defense, their opponents do not know where to attack.
If the opposing army is angry, shame it; if the army is strong, get it to relax. If the opposing general is proud, humiliate him; if the general is greedy, bait him; if the general is suspicious, spy on him right back - therefore the manner of victory is determined according to the enemy.
So a military force has no constant formation, water has no constant shape: the ability to gain victory by changing and adapting according to the opponent is called genius.
Once people are unified, the brave cannot proceed alone, the timid cannot retreat alone - this is the rule for employing a group.
A surrounded army must be given a way out.
When a territory is of marginal benefit and is as easy to lose as it is to win, then don't fight over it.
So the rule of military operations is not to count on opponents not coming, but to rely on having ways of dealing with them; not to count on opponents not attacking, but to rely on having what cannot be attacked.
When those sent to draw water first drink themselves, they are thirsty.

Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint
Humans were the weakest when they believed someone protected them. Once authority was established in a one-sided relationship, people started to depend on them.
Humans who hid behind anonymity would reveal the truth.
Time erased her cause and sense of justice. Once the cause disappeared, only the poor human truth remained.
Whenever a human faced an incomprehensible emotion, they would try to forcefully gain an answer. Everyone watching the scene felt a sense of exaltation. It was as if they had been waiting for someone to fix the situation.
Everyone looked around but they couldn't figure out the situation. Maybe it was because they enjoyed peace for too long. Their cerebral cortex, which had always assumed the worst, were now brainwashed to only imagine the safest future.
The monster let out a small cry. Perhaps no one had seen its wounds before. The cuts were created a long time ago. These wounds were the very existence of this monster. Due to these wounds, the monster became strong but it also became lonely. Shin Yoosung's face distorted as if she vividly felt the pain. "You shouldn't be a monster just because you are hurt." Shin Yoosung slowly touched the monster's injuries. However, they were wounds that couldn't be healed no matter how long passed.
Because of this, Kim Dokja still hates his mother. This is what human emotions are like. There is no magic that will heal all wounds just because someone else has a deep wound as well.
There was no such thing as a clock in the Demon Realm. Such things were only meaningful to beings with lives as short as humans.
I watched the bewildered faces of the citizens. In fact, I knew. They didn't do this with a clear purpose. Perhaps the citizens themselves didn't understand why they were trying to gather coins. They just had the compulsion to survive and collect more coins than other incarnations. The scenarios made the incarnations slaves to the story.
"Everyone has a wall and communication is impossible...that's obvious." I couldn't believe the friendly Jang Hayoung thought so. It was a bit surprising. Then Jang Hayoung continued, "However, we still have to talk. Even if there is a huge wall, there is a person behind that wall." "...What can we say when there is a wall?" "Write on the wall." My mouth dropped open at the brazen words. "If you shit or pee, you will leave something on the wall. That way, the other party will recognize it." "Why would you do such a thing? The other person is beyond the wall anyway..." "Still, you should leave a mark." "Does that make sense?" "There is no apparent meaning." "Then?" "It is just important that you left it." "The other party won't know so why?" "At least the wall has changed." I was speechless for a moment. Jang Hayoung spoke in a resolute voice, "Then one day, someone might read it."
In fact, I'm not sure why there is a score on the stories. Every story has value. It is a story that is interesting to some people and salvation for others.
At that moment, Kim Dokja thought for the first time about what he really wanted to say. It was too far away and not yet visible. However, for at least one person who walked on the path, it was clear. He failed thousands of times while feeling frustrated and desperate. There was someone who tried to take this road before me. I recalled the man who walked on the road that no one else walked on and laughed. Then I very naturally came up with some words. "I..." No, perhaps this was the only thing I had to say. "I will create a 'new story' that never existed before."

Animal Farm
All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.
The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.
Man is the only creature that consumes without producing. He does not give milk, he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough, he cannot run fast enough to catch rabbits. Yet he is lord of all the animals. He sets them to work, he gives back to them the bare minimum that will prevent them from starving, and the rest he keeps for himself.
This work was strictly voluntary, but any animal who absented himself from it would have his rations reduced by half.
No one believes more firmly than Comrade Napoleon that all animals are equal. He would be only too happy to let you make your decisions for yourselves. But sometimes you might make the wrong decisions, comrades, and then where should we be?
Can you not understand that liberty is worth more than just ribbons?

To Kill a Mockingbird
Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.
Mockingbirds don't do one thing but make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat up people's gardens, don't nest in corncribs, they don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.
The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience.
Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing.
"You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view-" "Sir?" "-until you climb into his skin and walk around in it."

Tao Te Ching
When the world has the Way, running horses are retired to till the fields. When the world lacks the Way, war-horses are bred in the countryside. No crime is greater than approving of greed. No calamity is greater than discontent. No fault is greater than possesiveness.
The journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step.
Weapons, being instruments of ill omen, are not the tools of the cultured, who use them only when unavoidable, and consider it best to be aloof. They win without beautifying it: those who beautify it enjoy killing people. Those who enjoy killing people cannot get their will of the world. When you are an ascendancy of power, you handle it as you would a mourning: when you have killed many people, you weep for them in sorrow. When you win a war, you celebrate by mourning.
Skilled warriors of old were subtle, mysteriously powerful, so deep they were unknowable. Just because they are unknowable, I will try to describe them: their wariness was as that one crossing a river in winter; their caution was as that one of in fear of all around. They were serious as guests, relaxed as ice at the melting points. Simple as uncarved wood, open as the valleys, they were inscrutable as murky water.
Who can accept the disgrace of a nation is called ruler of the land.

The Masters of Huainan
Where there are repeated wars, the people are weakened; when they score repeated victories, rulers become haughty. Let haughty rulers command weakened people, and rare is the nation that will not perish as a result.

Buddhist Mingjiao
A lost country wars with weapons; a dictatorship wars with cunning; a kingdom wars with humanitarian justice; an empire wars with virtue; a utopia wars with non-doing.

Impressions on Reading History
The enlightened and the good get things done only from time to time while petty bureaucrats always support one another. Once slanderers and flatterers get their wishes sages and philosophers are deterred. The Great Process makes myriad beings of countless different types. Fragrant and foul are not put together the humane and the violent apply different norms. If you put them together how can they get along?

Lament of a Soldier's Wife
You're better off grass by the roadside Than wife to a soldier at war. The wedding bed not even warm Her man's now on the northern front. She remembers the day they parted How the snow flew o'er the landscape Bow and arrows heavy at his side Ice splitting his horse's hooves He is so far from home How can they hope to meet? It saddens her even to see sun and moon That shine on both her and her man Pining and pining she longs When will it ever end? Every night in labored dreams Her spirit crosses the northern front so far. But there is a rule in the army To be careful all of the time They cannot think of home and family But work mindlessly for defense Since ancient times men loyal to duty All have learned to die.

The curvature measures the curviness of the curve. Very intuitive.
I greatly overestimated my ability to swim. I don't swim.
You guys need to stop vaping. I swear every time I see someone vaping on the bus I want to kill them. The problem is whether or not I want to show up in tomorrow's headlines. "John Abbott professor kills students for vaping."
I live rent free in your head.
I was so close to eating rat poison. It's insulting on a human intelligence level.
Participation is like scratching my ass. Will you learn anything if I scratch my ass for 2 hours?

And now we're gonna use the mathematicians' favorite technique: desperation.

Fyodor Dostoyevsky.
The whole law of human existence consists in nothing other than a man's always being able to bow before the immeasurably great. If people are deprived of the immeasurably great, they will not live and will die in despair. The immeasurable and infinite are as necessary for man as the small planet he inhabits.

Xenophon
That...is the road to the obedience of compulsion. But there is a shorter way to a nobler goal, the obedience of the will. When the interests of mankind are at stake, they will obey with joy the man whom they believe to be wiser than themselves. You may prove this on all sides: you may see how the sick man will beg the doctor to tell him what he ought to do, how a whole ship's company will listen to the pilot.
